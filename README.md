# Jelly Bean Technical Challenge

### Frontend
The Frontend is a React Application for the user to perform CRUD operations on the list of Jelly Bean flavors.

### Backend
The React Application makes API calls to the Python Django Backend. This Backend is built using the REST Framework for Django and uses SQLite to store the data.

### Instructions to Run
To start the React Application, start Node on your local machine via the terminal, enter the React directory, then enter the command: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

To start the Django Server, enter the Django directory in a separate terminal, then enter the command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this technical challenge.
